## Project Coding Standards

### Comments
- Avoid obvious comments that merely repeat what the code does.
- Only add comments when they add real value explaining "why", not "what".
- Write all comments in English.
- If you need to comment a variable, consider if a better variable name would eliminate the need.
- **Self-documenting code**: Good code documents itself through clear naming, simple structure, and obvious intent. Comments should explain "why" not "what". If you need to explain "what" the code does, consider refactoring for clarity instead.
- **XML Documentation**: Only document public APIs. For public APIs, standard XML comments documenting parameters and return values are acceptable even if they seem obvious - they serve as official API documentation. For internal/private methods, avoid obvious XML comments that repeat method names or parameter types. Focus on business value, edge cases, or non-obvious behavior.
- **Property XML Comments**: If a class uses XML comments for its properties, document all properties or remove the comments entirely. Prefer descriptive property names so additional comments are rarely needed.
- **Complex logic documentation**: For complex algorithms, regex patterns, bit manipulations, 
- **Examples of obvious comments to avoid**:
  ```csharp
  // BAD - obvious comments
  catch (JsonException)
  {
      // If parsing fails, return null
      return null;
  }
  
  
  // Increment counter
  counter++;
  
  // Check if user is null
  if (user == null) return;
  
  /// Modern implementation using new API instead of obsolete methods
  public void ProcessData() { }
  
  /// Updates user settings with new values
  public void UpdateUserSettings(UserSettings settings) { }
  
  // GOOD - valuable comments
  // Using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API during retries
  await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, attempt)));
  
  // WorkAround: Azure API sometimes returns stale data, force refresh after writes
  cache.InvalidateKey(userId);
  
  /// <summary>
  /// Validates credit card using Luhn algorithm. Returns false for test cards in development.
  /// </summary>
  public bool ValidateCreditCard(string number) { }

  ```

### Control Flow
- Minimize use of `if…else`; prefer guard clauses and early `return`.
- Avoid deep nesting of `if` statements; use early exits to keep methods flat.
- Create router methods that delegate to appropriate specialized services based on conditions.
- For simple guard clauses, it's acceptable to omit braces and keep the statement on a single line (e.g., `if (question == null) return;`).

### JSON Serialization
- Use `System.Text.Json` for all JSON (de)serialization.

### MudBlazor
- MudDialog visibility property is "Visible", not IsVisible

### C# Conventions
- Use PascalCase for classes, methods, properties, and public fields.
- Use camelCase for parameters, local variables, and private fields.
- Prefix interfaces with `I` (e.g., `IUserService`).
- Use primary constructors when appropriate (C# 12+).
- Prefer `System.Threading.Lock` over `object` for synchronization.
- **Parameter naming**: Parameter names must match their semantic purpose in the method. Avoid generic names that don't reflect the actual data type or business meaning.
- **ID parameters MUST be descriptive**: Never use a bare `id`. Always use `<entity>Name + Id` that reflects the domain meaning:
- When renaming parameters, update usages including `nameof(...)`, logging placeholders, and validation messages.
- Return `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` instead of `List<T>` when modification isn't required.

### Error Handling
- Return empty collections (`[]`) instead of null when no data is available.
- Log errors with structured logging using ILogger.
- **Fail-fast principle**: Throw exceptions for invalid parameters instead of returning default values that mask bugs. If a required ID/parameter is missing or invalid, throw `InvalidOperationException` or `ArgumentException` with clear error message.
- **Fail Fast / Design by Contract:** Validate required invariants and configuration once at startup; avoid scattered backup paths and null checks—after initialization, treat values as valid and non-null. If absence is intentional, model it explicitly with `std::optional` and handle it only at boundaries.
- **No silent fallbacks for required data**: When a configuration or domain value is required (e.g., a server name), use it directly without `null`/empty fallbacks. Let missing data surface as errors instead of defaulting to placeholders like `ToString()` or empty strings.

### Architecture
- Follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns.
- Use dependency injection for service registration and resolution.
- Organize code into logical layers: API, Services, Models, Shared.
- Follow DRY principle: extract duplicated logic into helper classes or services.
- Create specialized services for complex operations instead of embedding logic in multiple places.
- **Method overloads**: Don't create overloads that merely delegate to another signature — keep one universal version and replace calls accordingly.
- **Avoid parameter pass-through methods**: If a method only receives parameters to create an object and return it at the end, consider removing the method and creating the object directly in the calling code. Methods should perform meaningful logic, not just pass parameters to constructors.
- **Don't return input parameters**: Avoid returning the same parameters that were passed as input to the method. It's redundant and adds no value. If a method receives an ID and needs to return it unchanged, the caller already has that ID.
- **Avoid tuple returns**: Returning tuples is often a sign of poor design. Consider creating a dedicated class/record or refactoring the method to have a single responsibility. If you find yourself returning multiple unrelated values, the method is likely doing too much.
- **Factory methods exception**: Factory methods like `CreateFromDomainModel` or similar that combine multiple operations for code readability and provide meaningful naming are acceptable and improve code clarity.

### Modern C# Features
- Use target-typed expressions where appropriate (`return [];`).
- Leverage nullable reference types for better null safety.
- Use pattern matching and modern C# syntax when it improves readability.
